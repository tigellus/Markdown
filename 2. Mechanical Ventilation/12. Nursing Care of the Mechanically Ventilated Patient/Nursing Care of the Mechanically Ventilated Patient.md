# Nursing Care of the Mechanically Ventilated Patient

### Assessment of patient
* Signs and symptoms of inadequate ventilation or oxygenation --> monitor minute volume, tidal volume, ABG, SpO2
* Signs and symptoms of possible pneumothorax and progression to tension pneumothorax --> caution with high PEEP, monitor lung sounds, watch for mediastinal shift

### Patient Care: Comfort and Communication
* Remove airway secretions- both oral and endotracheal
* Provide different ways to communicate (communication board, yes/no questions)
* Remove accumulated water from tubing/ensure that it drains away from the patient's airway
* Comfort measures: assist with positioning, turn q2 hours, range of motion exercises, reduce pressure on bony prominences, oral care

### Safety
* Patients are often restrained when mechanically ventilated: ensure physician orders are per facility policy, monitor skin integrity under and around restraints, ensure patient cannot reach the ETT or ventilator circuitry but also that restraints are not excessively tight or restrictive.
* Monitor for agitation and resltessness due to restraints and/or the discomfort of mechanical ventilation
* Monitor and titrate continuous sedation to facilitate patient comfort and increase compliance with the ventilator. Do not oversedate- ensure physician orders indicate a clear goal sedation score.
* Educate patient and family members about importance of the mechanical ventilator and ETT.

### Clinical Indications for Suctioning
Do not suction routinely- should have a clear indication to suction. This is stressful for the patient.
Indications:
* Audible secretions
* Coughing
* Respiratory distress/ hypoxia due to secretions
* Assess and improve airway patency

### Technique
* Sterile technique: use in-line suction that is part of the ventilator set up- this should be constantly connected to suction tubing with wall suction on. Compressing the thumb control button activates suctioning.
* Diameter of suction tubing should be no more than half the diameter of the ETT/tracheostomy
* Ensure wall suction is appropriately set up in the patient's room
* Ensure that suctioning is indicated by assessment
* Preoxygenate patient with "O2 Breath" or FiO2 100% x2mn, inform the patient that suctioning will occur
* Secure ETT/tracheostomy with non-dominant hand
* Quickly but gently advance in-line suction catheter down the ETT/tracheostomy with dominant hand until resistance is met (patient may cough)- Do not compress suction button during catheter insertion
* Compress the thumb control button to activate suction and simultaneously pull the catheter out of the ETT/tracheostomy- this should take no longer than 10-15 seconds
* Limit suctioning time per attempt
* Once suctioning complete, ensure suction catheter tip is out of the ETT/tracheostomy. It will remain in its sterile catheter sheath.
* Monitor patient tolerance, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.


# ~Question 2
When is suctioning clinically indicated for mechanically ventilated patients?

[WRONG] Every 2 hours
[WRONG] Hypotension
[RIGHT] When coughing or with audible secretions

# ~Question 3
Which of the following describes appropriate suctioning technique?

[WRONG] Activate suctioning while advancing the in-line suction catheter
[WRONG] Ensure multiple suction attempts are conducted each time
[RIGHT] Limit suction time to 10-15 seconds

# ~Question 5
Which of the following is a risk of long-term 100% oxygen?

[RIGHT] Oxygen toxicity
[WRONG] Cerebral edema
[WRONG] Cyanosis
[WRONG] Hypercapnia

# ~Question 6
Which actions helps to decrease the complications associated with endotracheal suctioning?

[WRONG] Use only 50% oxygen before and after suctioning
[WRONG] Remove the sterile suction set up each time a patient is suctioned
[WRONG] Do not used a closed suction system
[RIGHT] Only suction when patient assessment indicates a need

# ~Question 7
Identify one way to provide controlled ventilation for a patient who is consistently agitated.

[WRONG] Restrain the patient
[RIGHT] Administer continuous sedation
[WRONG] Tell the patient to be calm
[WRONG] Have a nursing assistant sit with the patient

# Prone Positioning
Patients with ARDS can benefit from prone positioning as this enhances V/Q matching. This is typically indicated for a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of less than 100 and/or in patients who are not responding to other therapies. Perfusion shifts from the posterior portions of the lung (when the patient is supine) to the anterior, larger portions of the lungs (when the patient is prone). Prone positioning also enhances ventilation by removing the weight of the heart and abdomen on the lungs. 
Prone positioning is traditionally accomplished with a specialized bed that requires close monitoring by the RN and RT.

Considerations:
* Increased ocular pressure due to inadequate eyelid closure and dependent edema when prone: tape eyes closed, lubricate
* Skin breakdown in new anterior areas (eg. knees, shins, face, breasts, shoulders, iliac crests)
* In the case of a code, secure the patient, press the "CPR" button and the patient will be immediately placed supine, begin chest compressions
* Facial edema: consider cooling packs to patient face when supine if indicated
* Place IV extension tubing for all IV infusions to allow for rotation of the bed
* Prevent possible gastric aspiration (often pause enteral feeds prior to turning)

# ~Question 1
What is the rationale for prone positioning?
[RIGHT] Enhances V/Q matching
[WRONG] An effective weaning mode
[WRONG] Reduces perfusion to lung tissue
[WRONG] Increases the weight of the heart and abdomen on the lungs

# ~Question 2
Which is a major consideration for prone positioning?

[RIGHT] Lubricate the eyes and tape the eyes closed
[WRONG] Ensure IV tubing is shortened to reduce obstacles in patient care
[WRONG] CPR cannot be performed on these patients
[WRONG] Skin breakdown is less of a risk due to changes in weight distribution
