# Non-Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation

Method of ventilation without an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy: tight-fitting nasal, oro-nasal or face mask attached to a non-invasive positive pressure ventilator (NPPV or CPAP/BIPAP) unit.

The NPPV unit can be programmed to deliver:

* Respiratory rate
* Inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP)
* Expiratory pressure (EPAP)
* Supplemental FiO2 

# Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)
Provides continuous positive pressure to keep alveoli open and enhance ventilation and oxygenation
* Decreases work of breathing (WOB)
* Increases Oxygenation by enhancing ventilation and facilitating oxygen delivery
* Potential complication: Positive pressure increases intrathoracic pressure which can decrease cardiac preload (blood return to the heart) and thus cardiac output (blood pumped out of the heart)

# Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP)
Provides two levels of continuous positive pressure: one amount of pressure during exhalation (to keep alveoli open) and one (higher) amount of pressure during inhalation (to keep alveoli open and to further decrease WOB)
* Decreases work of breathing (WOB)- can provide more support than CPAP
* Increases Oxygenation by enhancing ventilation and facilitating oxygen delivery
* Potential complication: Positive pressure increases intrathoracic pressure which can decrease cardiac preload (blood return to the heart) and thus cardiac output (blood pumped out of the heart)

# Nursing Considerations

### Indications:
* To avoid intubation in a patient with respiratory distress
* To avoid reintubation in a patient who has been extubated
* To provide ventilatory support in a patient who is "DNI" (do not intubate)

### Contraindications:
* Somnolence
* Claustrophobia
* High aspiration risk
* Inability to clear secretions
* Recent facial or gastroesophageal surgery
* Craniofacial trauma
* Burns

### Nursing Care
* Aerosolized Intervention: Use N95 mask when caring for patients using either BiPAP or CPAP.
* Collaborate with respiratory therapy to ensure mask fits appropriately and there are no air leaks
* Monitor patient's tidal volume, ABG, RR
* Monitor for signs of respiratory decompensation

### Monitor for potential complications:
* signs of low preload and low cardiac output
* skin integrity issues around face and drying of mucous membranes
* patient comfort due to nature of mask
* aspiration
* respiratory drive
* malnutrition or dehydration (due to possible reduced oral intake)
