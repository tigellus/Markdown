# Non-Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation
<!---0e3f7f71-480d-462e-9bc2-4d9c92f69209-->

For air to enter the lungs, a pressure gradient must exist between the airway and the alveoli. This can be accomplished either by raising pressure at the airway (positive-pressure ventilation) or by lowering pressure at the level of the alveolus (negative-pressure ventilation).

The iron lung or tank ventilator is the most common type of negative-pressure ventilator used in the past. These ventilators work by creating subatmospheric pressure around the chest, thereby lowering pleural and alveolar pressure and facilitating flow of air into the patientâ€™s lungs.

Method of ventilation without an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy: tight-fitting nasal, oro-nasal or face mask attached to a non-invasive positive pressure ventilator (NPPV or CPAP/BIPAP) unit.

The NPPV unit can be programmed to deliver:

* Respiratory rate
* Inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP)
* Expiratory pressure (EPAP)
* Supplemental FiO2

## Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)
Provides continuous positive pressure to keep alveoli open and enhance ventilation and oxygenation
* Decreases work of breathing (WOB)
* Increases Oxygenation by enhancing ventilation and facilitating oxygen delivery
* Potential complication: Positive pressure increases intrathoracic pressure which can decrease cardiac preload (blood return to the heart) and thus cardiac output (blood pumped out of the heart)

## Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP)
Provides two levels of continuous positive pressure: one amount of pressure during exhalation (to keep alveoli open) and one (higher) amount of pressure during inhalation (to keep alveoli open and to further decrease WOB)
* Decreases work of breathing (WOB)- can provide more support than CPAP
* Increases Oxygenation by enhancing ventilation and facilitating oxygen delivery
* Potential complication: Positive pressure increases intrathoracic pressure which can decrease cardiac preload (blood return to the heart) and thus cardiac output (blood pumped out of the heart)

Iron lung ventilators used after the polio epidemics in the first half of the 20th century belong to

[WRONG] Positive Pressure Ventilation
[RIGHT] Negative pressure Ventilation

# ~Question 5
<!---b503ad0b-ffad-4540-8dd9-06d08ab8911f-->
CPAP and BiPAP modes are usually used

[WRONG] In conjunction with bronchodilators and steroids
[WRONG] To delay intubation
[WRONG] As a weaning protocol
[RIGHT] All of the options

# ~Question 2
<!---5b7502c3-bdf4-4e4b-8c3b-923fc576e1bf-->
What is the difference between invasive and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation?

[RIGHT] Invasive positive pressure ventilation is delivered via an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy
[WRONG] Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation is delivered via an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy

# Nursing Considerations
<!---01307ee7-c549-4a47-b5a5-cc1fda8a6355-->

### Indications:
* To avoid intubation in a patient with respiratory distress
* To avoid reintubation in a patient who has been extubated
* To provide ventilatory support in a patient who is "DNI" (do not intubate)

### Contraindications:
* Somnolence
* Claustrophobia
* High aspiration risk
* Inability to clear secretions
* Recent facial or gastroesophageal surgery
* Craniofacial trauma
* Burns

### Nursing Care
* Aerosolized Intervention: Use N95 mask when caring for patients using either BiPAP or CPAP.
* Collaborate with respiratory therapy to ensure mask fits appropriately and there are no air leaks
* Monitor patient's tidal volume, ABG, RR
* Monitor for signs of respiratory decompensation

### Monitor for potential complications:
* Signs of low preload and low cardiac output
* Skin integrity issues around face and drying of mucous membranes
* Patient comfort due to nature of mask
* Aspiration
* Respiratory drive
* Malnutrition or dehydration (due to possible reduced oral intake)
