Mechanical ventilation is frequently used to provide respiratory support in times of critical illness or in patients undergoing general anaesthesia. This course provides learners with the knowledge and resources to provide essential care to critical ICU patients with coronavirus, including identifying the underlying cause for the need of mechanical ventilation, assessing patients, understanding alarm systems as well as operating a ventilator. 

The course consists of 5 chapters, with 19 articles and 42 questions in total. For the chapters that have questions, we will ask an array of questions to assess your skills and identify existing knowledge gaps before going into the theory.
