<!---7c23e9e1-9746-40d1-a884-6e60812935e7-->

The following video lectures provide learners with an overview of mechanical ventilation, including ventilator modes, settings, monitoring, management and case studies.

The following links redirect to video lectures provided by the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) to support you and other nurses who need to cross train to care for mechanically ventilated patients.
