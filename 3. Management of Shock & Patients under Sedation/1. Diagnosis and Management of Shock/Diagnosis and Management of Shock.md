Septic shock and specific organ dysfunction such as acute kidney injury appear to occur in a significant proportion of patients with COVID-19–related critical illness and are associated with increasing mortality. Recommendations for managing shock follow the available evidence-based guidelines.

The goals of this session are:
* Review the primary categories of shock
* Discuss goals of resuscitation in shock
