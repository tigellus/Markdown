usually these are taught as "high flow" and "low flow" rather than aerosollized and non-aerosolized--- however some of the questions/images use aerosollized and non-aerosolized--
low-flow systems (nasal cannula, simple face mask, partial-rebreather mask, and non-rebreather mask), and high-flow systems (air-entrainment or Venturi mask and high-flow nasal cannula).

I disagreed with some of the benefits of HFNC (these are potential, but not the intended benefits of HFNC-- it does not provide ventilatory support)- I think these could go under nursing implications
