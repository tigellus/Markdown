This section should be re-titled "Arterial Blood Gasses" not "Pulmonary ABG"
Typically we avoid negatively phrased questions like "Which is NOT a cause of..." this does not assess learning as much as asking "which is a cause of"
I felt like an explanation for ABG disturbances was lacking- I created a youtube video on introduction to ABGs that is open to the public if you want to add it to this module: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjrzZiprg04&list=PLZS9jYlFdlUDTGXMa5Q5xnN2S52RfwZUG&index=7

I haven't heard use of "correction" and "compensation" before- we usually use "fully or partially compensated"

I made a lot of edits to the quiz questions-- trying to focus on essential information. Some errors in correct/incorrect answers. I rephrased according to common verbiage used in recent evidence.
