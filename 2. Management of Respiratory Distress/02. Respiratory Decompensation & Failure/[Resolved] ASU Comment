I'm not sure about the "changes in respiratory status" heading as this is difficult to define-- if the goals is to teach them about respiratory failure and "lead in" to this, then I'd recommend the heading I've proposed and then later headings/sections could be:

Diagnostic criteria
Early signs (include "change in respiratory status" information here)
-Decompensation
Late signs

Depending on time available (in a perfect world) I would ask much higher level questions here-- eg. questions where a patient with specific symptoms presents and the nurse has to determine what is going on based on that assessment.
