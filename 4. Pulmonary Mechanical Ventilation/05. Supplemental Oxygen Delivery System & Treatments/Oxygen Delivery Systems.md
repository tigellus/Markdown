## Non-Aerosolized Oxygen Delivery Systems

![](assets/no_aerosol.png)

These are used for patients that need supplemental oxygen and are breathing on their OWN.

#### Nursing Implications

* Dries the airway, thickening secretions and making it difficult for the patient to cough up
* Increases Infection Risk of the Patient
* Can cause patient discomfort

## Aerosolized Oxygen Delivery System: High Flow Nasal Cannula

![](assets/aerosol.png)

* You must use N95 when caring for patients on HFNC.
* Set flow 10-50L
* FiO2: 21-100%
* No Alarms
* #1 issue is cannula kinks
 *If FiO2 goes higher than
       originally set, there might be
       a kink on the cannula prongs


#### Benefits of HFNC

* Reduces
    * Respiratory rate
    * Carbon dioxide level
    * Breathing effort
* Increases
    * Tidal volume
* Improves
    * Mucus clearance
    * Oxygenation

# Question 1
When should non-aerosolized Oxygen Delivery Systems be used?
[RIGHT] For patients that need supplemental oxygen and are breathing on their own
[WRONG] For patients that need supplemental oxygen and are struggling to breathe on their own
[WRONG] For patients that need supplemental oxygen and cannot breathe on their own

# Question 2
Question: An ascending ranking of non-aerosolized oxygen delivery systems by flow rate is:
[RIGHT] Low Flow Nasal Cannula, Simple Face Mask, Humidified High Flow Mask, Venturi Style Mask, Reservoir Mask
[WRONG] Low Flow Nasal Cannula, Simple Face Mask, Venturi Style Mask, Humidified High Flow Mask, Reservoir Mask
[WRONG] Low Flow Nasal Cannula, Simple Face Mask, Venturi Style Mask, Reservoir Mask, Humidified High Flow Mask
[WRONG] Low Flow Nasal Cannula, Simple Face Mask, Humidified High Flow Mask, Reservoir Mask, Venturi Style Mask

# Question 3
What are the nursing implications of using non-aerosolized oxygen delivery systems?
[RIGHT] Patients’ airway dries, secretions thicken, coughing up is harder, infection risk increases
[WRONG] Patients’ airway dries, secretions thin, coughing up is easier, infection risk decreases
[WRONG] Patients’ airway dries, secretions thicken, coughing up is easier, infection risk increases
[WRONG] Patients’ airway dries, secretions thin, coughing up is harder, infection risk decreases

# Question 4
What are the key benefits of a High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC)?
[WRONG] Increases respiratory rate, Reduces breathing effort, Increases tidal volume, Reduces mucus clearance
[RIGHT] Reduces respiratory rate, Reduces breathing effort, Increases tidal volume, Improves mucus clearance
[WRONG] Reduces respiratory rate, Reduces breathing effort, Decreases tidal volume, Improves mucus clearance

# Question 5
High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) increases…
[RIGHT] Tidal volume
[WRONG] Respiratory rate
[WRONG] Carbon dioxide level
[WRONG] Breathing effort
