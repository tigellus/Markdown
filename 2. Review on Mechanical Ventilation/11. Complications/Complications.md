Guard against incorrect ventilator settings.
Ventilator disconnect from patient is a common problem.

# Complications of Mechanical Ventilation

### Infection
* Normal filtering system (nasopharynx) is bypassed by the artificial airway
* Breaks in aseptic technique and nosocomial infections
* Immunocompromised, unstable, and/or critically ill patients at higher risk
* Common infection: Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP) due to aspiration of gastric contents or colonized oral secretions
-->strategies to reduce VAP: Elevate HOB 30-45 degrees, hand hygiene, ensure condensation in ventilator circuit drains away from the patient's airway, suctioning of subglottic secretions, thorough oral hygiene per facility protocol, peptic ulcer prevention

### Airway Obstruction
* Inadequate humidification causing thickened mucus
* Increased secretions with inadequate pulmonary toiletry
* Patient biting tube

### Atelectasis
* Due to immobility/bedrest and/or inadequate tidal volume
* Monitor for low grade fever
* Frequent respiratory assessments


### Oxygen Toxicity --> can combine this one with what I put in the last module
* Prolonged high oxygen levels – FiO2 0.7-1.0
* Excessive oxygen can impairs surfactant activity

### Pulmonary Trauma (I believe this was also on the prior module-- barotrauma)
* Barotrauma: alveolar injury or rupture due to excess pressure (can be due to excessive PEEP, high Vt)
* Pneumothorax: Positive pressure causing a break in the integrity of the visceral pleura-- can result from severe barotrauma
* Tension Pneumothorax: watch for mediastinal shift, immediate intervention indicated- use BVM until physician can perform needle decompression

[I deleted this because it was parsed out in other sections- atelectasis, pulmonary trauma etc]

# Decreased cardiac output
* Decreased venous return
* Relief of work effort
* PEEP
* Inadequate fluid volume status

### Ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction (VIDD)
* Ventilatory muscle abnormalities induced by mechanical ventilatory strategies that suppress or eliminate spontaneous ventilatory muscle activity
* Patients perform little or no work to receive ventilatory support. Ventilatory muscles thus receive virtually no neural stimulation and have virtually no muscle loading.
* Prevent by adjusting level of unloading as fatigue recovery occurs

### Gastrointestinal & Nutrition Complications
* GI bleed --> monitor for gross and occult blood
* Stress increases gastric acid production, PUD --> PUD prophylaxis, reduce stress
* Malnutrition --> early supplemental nutrition (enteral preferred if indicated)

Malnourishment may cause:
* Reduced response to hypoxia and hypercapnia
* Muscle atrophy
* Respiratory infection
* Decreased surfactant production
* Slowed healing of damaged tissues
* Lower serum albumin levels

#### Overfeeding
* Problems with COPD and other patients unable to clear CO2
* Increased risk for aspiration
* Feeding with high carbohydrate tube feedings or parenteral nutrition increases the CO2 load
* Use of lipids to replace some of the caloric needs can reduce carbohydrate load

# Question 1
Which of the following can cause airway obstruction with mechanical ventilation?

[WRONG] Decreased secretions
[WRONG] Excessive humidification
[RIGHT] Patient biting the tube

# Question 2
What mechanical ventilation complication causes a break in the integrity of the visceral pleura?

[WRONG] Pneumonia
[WRONG] Pulmonary embolism
[RIGHT] Pneumothorax

# Question 3
What can cause a patient to become hypotensive during mechanical ventilation?

[WRONG] Increased pulmonary blood flow
[WRONG] Normal positive pressure becomes negative pressure and increases venous return
[RIGHT] Normal negative pressure becomes positive pressure and decreases venous return

[WRONG] Placing the head of bed at 15 degrees
[RIGHT] Subglottic suctioning
[WRONG] Increase stomach acid production

# Question 5
Which of the following is correct?

[WRONG] Mechanically ventilated patients are at reduced risk for peptic ulcer disease
[WRONG] Thinning secretions can increase airway obstruction
[RIGHT] Mechanically ventilated patients are at increased risk for GI bleed

# Question 6
A patient has been on the mechanical ventilator with continuous sedation fo 7 days in CMV mode. What problem is this patient at highest risk for?

[WRONG] Pneumothorax
[WRONG] Airway obstruction

[RIGHT] Be difficult to wean from the ventilator

[WRONG] Have a low cardiac output

# Question 8
How can you prevent Ventilator-Induced Diaphragmatic Dysfunction (VIDD):

[WRONG] Sedating the patient to make the diaphragm and other respiratory muscles rest until the infection if fully treated.
[RIGHT] Limiting controlled ventilation to the minimum necessary. As soon as the patient's respiratory function allows and as soon as the patient's respiratory drive recovers, the patient should trigger the ventilator and participate in the breathing effort.
[WRONG] Giving high level of ventilator support to the patient until the disease is completely treated, then training the patient with very little assist for long periods.
[WRONG] Allowing spontaneous breathing during the entire period on mechanical ventilation, despite other indications. 

# Question 1
