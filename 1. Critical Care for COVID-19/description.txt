This course lays the foundation for providing medical attention to patients infected by COVID-19 in an ICU setting. The course structure involves several aspects of using protective personal equipment, detecting patient symptoms, collecting specimens for testing and managing sedated patients, all of which will assist learners in caring for critical COVID-19 patients.

The course consists of 4 chapters, with 8 articles and 22 questions in total. Two of the chapters will also contain related videos. Before going into the theory in Chapter 1, 2 and 3, we will ask an array of questions to assess your skills and identify existing knowledge gaps.
