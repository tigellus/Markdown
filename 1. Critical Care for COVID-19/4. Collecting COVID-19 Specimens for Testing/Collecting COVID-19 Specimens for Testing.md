# ~Question 1
What does a specimen collection kit for COVID-19 consist of?

[RIGHT] 1 Nasopharyngeal swab and 1 Tube of Universal Transport Media (UTM)
[WRONG] 1 Nasopharyngeal aspirate and 1 Tube of Universal Transport Media (UTM)
[WRONG] 2  Nasopharyngeal swabs and 1 Tube of Universal Transport Media (UTM)


# Specimen Collection Types

### Nasopharyngeal specimen (CDC recommended specimen type)
Materials: 1 Flock swab in viral transport media (i.e. Hank's® Media)

The individual collecting the specimen should wear a face mask, gown, gloves and face shield. An N95 Mask is not required.

The individual collecting the swab should wear a face mask, gown, gloves and face shield.

#### Steps for Nasopharyngeal swab (NP):

1. The distance from the patient's nose to ear gives an estimate of the distance the swab should be inserted.

    * Tilt patient’s head back 70 degrees.
    * Insert one swab straight back into one nostril (swab should reach depth equal to distance from nostrils to outer opening of ear).
    * Leave swab in place in the nostril for a few seconds.
    * Repeat in the other nostril, using the same swab for both nostrils.
    * Immediately place the swab into a vial containing viral transport media (i.e. Hank’s® Media) and break off remaining shaft to close the vial.

2. Send the swab to the laboratory (tube station 91).

3. If unable to obtain a specimen, escalate.

Another option for upper respiratory tract specimens, especially in children is NP wash/aspirate or nasal aspirate: 
* collect 2-3mL of specimen in a sterile, leak-proof, screw-cap sputum collection cup or sterile dry container.
