# Critical Care Handbook for COVID-19

Prior to beginning on a critical care unit, review the handbook for critical care management as a self-study tool. You may also use this handbook as a reference to review with your preceptor when you arrive on the unit.

Please note, this document will be updated on an ongoing basis as guidance evolves.

You can find the handbook here:
