# Critical Care for Non-Interventionists

This session will provide an overview of critical care for non-interventionists.

## Symptoms of COVID-19 patients

The spectrum of symptomatic COVID-19 infection ranges from mild to critical; most infections are not severe. Specifically, in a report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention that included approximately 44,500 confirmed infections with an estimation of disease severity:

- *Mild* (no or mild pneumonia) was reported in 81 percent.
- *Severe* (e.g. with dyspnea, hypoxia, or >50 percent lung involvement on imaging within 24 to 48 hours) was reported in 14 percent.
- *Critical* (e.g. with respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction) was reported in 5 percent.

## Care of patients who are critically ill

The topic addressed in the sessions are:
* COVID-19 Basics
* Recognition and care of patients who are critically ill, hypotensive, in acute respiratory failure, or mechanically ventilated
* COVID-19 unit workflow
* Assessing patients' respiratory status
* Ventilator basics

# ~Question 1
Concerning the level of care, which one is incorrect? 
[RIGHT] Higher the threshold for ICU transfer 
[WRONG] Pattens with confirmed COVID-19 with rapidly increasing O2 requirements, non-rebreather, or NIV should be transferred to intermediate/ICU level of care 

* Lower the threshold for ICU transfer 

# ~Question 2
In which one of those areas can one wear surgical mask only (no N95 required) ?
[RIGHT]In patient room
[WRONG]Aerosol generating procedures
[WRONG]In room with PUI/COVID+ patients on HFNC/BIPAP
 
* In patient room: surgical face mask, face shield, isolation gown, gloves

# ~Question 3
Which of the statement about intubation is incorrect? 
[RIGHT]Have a high threshold for intubation
[WRONG]N95 (instead of surgical mask), face shield, double gloves, blue plastic gown, hat must be used
[WRONG]Plan for rapid sequence intubation by most experienced physician. 
[WRONG]Ideally 2 people (max 3) in room during intubation

* Have a low threshold for early intubation in order to avoid emergent intubations. Covid-19 patients can deteriorate rapidly 

# ~Question 4
Which of the statements about admission workflow is correct:
[RIGHT]Use COVID-19-orderset
[RIGHT]New admissions perform a medication reconciliation of home meds 
[RIGHT]Identify the health-care proxy and/or surrogates and confirm accurate phone numbers. Make sure this is documented in the advanced care planning tab and also an advanced care planning note
[RIGHT]Confirm code status with patient or with NOK/HCP/surrogate if patient is incapacitated
[RIGHT]Consult ID to discuss treatment/clinical trial options
[RIGHT]You should never enter a room without donning appropriate PPE
[RIGHT]Routinely bleach/wipe your workstations 

# ~Question 5
Which of the statements about Rounding/Pre-Ronding in the COVID-19 unit is **incorrect**?
[WRONG]Step 1: Get sign-out from the overnight team on new admissions and major overnight events
[WRONG]Step 2: EPIC re-rounding for vitals, labs, blood gas/lactate and vent support required, new microbiology data, ins/outs
[RIGHT]Step 3: see patients (either rom door) or call patients as needed. Do physical exam if the condition of patients change.
* Step 3: see patients (either rom door) or call patients as needed. Minimize exposure, in/out. A physical exam is NOT necessary for routine care of COVID-19 patients and is extremely discouraged

# ~Question 6
Which of the following are the warning signs of respiratory decompensation? 
[RIGHT]Rapidly escalating O2 requirement (eg. RA —> 6L NC —> NRM in short period of time, eg minutes to hours)
[RIGHT]Inability to maintain sats in the 90s on escalated O2 therapy
[RIGHT]Respiratory distress including: tachypnea, accessory muscle use, inability to speak in full sentences
[WRONG]Patients with COVID-19 often feel very little dyspnea 
[RIGHT]Patients have very little reserve and decompensated quickly and profoundly. It is important to stay vigilant and escalate your concerns early

* Note that patients with COVID-19 often feel very little dyspnea despite being profoundly hypodermic, for unclear reasons

# ~Question 7
Which of following needs to be assessed when asked to consider patient’s respiratory status 
[RIGHT]Vitals : heart rate, respiratory rate, SpO2 
[RIGHT]Physical exam and appearance: grimacing, using abdominal and accessory muscles, or tachypnea without distress
[RIGHT]Arterial blood gas analysis: pH/pCO2/pO2/lactate
