## Low-Flow Oxygen Delivery Systems

![](assets/no_aerosol.png)

Used for patients that need supplemental oxygen and have sufficient respiratory drive (breathing on their own)
#### Nursing Implications for Low-Flow Systems

* Can dry the airway, thicken secretions, and therefore cause difficulty in clearing secretions
* Consider humidification for oxygen flow greater than 4L/min
* Monitor respiratory drive and effort- watch for signs of decompensation
* Increases infection risk of the patient
* Can cause patient discomfort
* Actual amount of inspirted oxygen (FiO2) cannot be precisely controlled or predicted (is affected by patient's respiratory pattern)


## High-Flow Oxygen Delivery Systems

#### Nursing Implications for High-Flow Systems
* Provides a reservoir of oxygen in the patient's nasopharynx which enhances delivery of oxygen with each breath
* FiO2 delivery is fairly consistent
* Indicated for patients with a more variable ventilatory pattern
* Use of N95 mask required when caring for patients on HFNC.
* Oxygen flow rate typically 10-50L
* FiO2: 60-100%
* No Alarms (close monitoring by the nurse is necessary)
* Monitor respiratory drive and effort- watch for signs of decompensation
* Monitor for kinking in tubing
* If FiO2 goes higher than originally set, there might be a kink on the cannula prongs


# Question 1
When should Low-flow Oxygen Delivery Systems be used?

[RIGHT] For patients that need supplemental oxygen and are breathing on their own
[WRONG] For patients that need supplemental oxygen and have decreased respiratory drive
[WRONG] For patients that need supplemental oxygen and have variable respiratory effort

# Question 2
Question: An ascending ranking of low-flow oxygen delivery systems by flow rate is:

[RIGHT] Low Flow Nasal Cannula, Simple Face Mask, Humidified High Flow Mask, Venturi Style Mask, Reservoir Mask
[WRONG] Low Flow Nasal Cannula, Simple Face Mask, Venturi Style Mask, Humidified High Flow Mask, Reservoir Mask
[WRONG] Low Flow Nasal Cannula, Simple Face Mask, Venturi Style Mask, Reservoir Mask, Humidified High Flow Mask
[WRONG] Low Flow Nasal Cannula, Simple Face Mask, Humidified High Flow Mask, Reservoir Mask, Venturi Style Mask

# Question 3
What are the nursing implications of using low flow oxygen delivery systems? 

[RIGHT] Patients’ airway dries, secretions thicken, coughing up is harder, infection risk increases
[WRONG] Patients’ airway dries, secretions thin, coughing up is easier, infection risk decreases
[WRONG] Patients’ airway dries, secretions thicken, coughing up is easier, infection risk increases
[WRONG] Patients’ airway dries, secretions thin, coughing up is harder, infection risk decreases

# Question 4
What are the nursing implications of a High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC)?

[WRONG] Does not require the patient to have respiratory drive
[RIGHT] Provides more predictable and precise delivery of FiO2
[WRONG] Reduces risk for infection

# Question 5
When caring for a patient using HFNC, the nurse must

[RIGHT] Use an N95 mask
[WRONG] Ensure the patient is properly sedated
[WRONG] Use a simple face mask
[WRONG] Keep oxygen flow to less than 10 L/min
